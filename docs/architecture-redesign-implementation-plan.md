# Zyx Configuration Architecture Redesign - Implementation Plan

## Overview

This document provides a comprehensive implementation plan for redesigning the Zyx NixOS configuration from the ground up to be modular, extensible, testable, and maintainable. The redesign follows modern software engineering best practices with a test-first approach.

## Design Principles

1. **Testing-First Development**: Every module must have comprehensive unit and integration tests
2. **Capability-Driven Architecture**: Hardware/platform capabilities determine available features
3. **Layer Separation**: Clear boundaries between platform, service, and user layers
4. **Dependency Injection**: Services depend on abstractions, not implementations
5. **Platform Agnostic**: Core logic works across NixOS, Darwin, and future platforms
6. **Type Safety**: Strong validation and assertions prevent configuration errors

## Development Best Practices

### Testing Requirements
- **NEVER** implement a module without corresponding tests
- **ALWAYS** run `nix flake check` before committing changes
- Write unit tests for individual module logic and options
- Write integration tests for complete system configurations
- Test failure scenarios and assertion violations
- Use mock hardware configurations for consistent testing

### Git Workflow
- Commit changes frequently with descriptive messages
- Test each commit individually to ensure no regressions
- Use conventional commit format: `type(scope): description`
- Always test configuration changes on the eye-of-god system before merging
- Use feature branches for major architectural changes

### Module Development Standards
- Follow existing import patterns and naming conventions
- Use capability detection before enabling hardware-dependent features
- Implement platform-specific code behind abstraction layers
- Document module interfaces and dependencies
- Validate configuration options with assertions
- Provide meaningful error messages for configuration failures

### Performance Requirements
- Module evaluation should complete within 2 seconds on modern hardware
- Avoid expensive computations during option evaluation
- Use lazy evaluation and caching where appropriate
- Profile configuration builds to identify bottlenecks

## Current Implementation Reference

└── hosts/ (existing)           # Host configurations
```

### Module Development Patterns

#### 1. Standard Module Structure

All new modules follow this pattern:

```nix
# modules/platform/detection.nix
{ lib, pkgs, config, ... }:

{
  # Option definitions with proper types and descriptions
  options.platform = {
    type = lib.mkOption {
      type = lib.types.enum [ "nixos" "darwin" "droid" ];
      description = "The platform type this configuration is running on";
      default = /* auto-detection logic */;
    };
    
    capabilities = {
      isLinux = lib.mkOption {
        type = lib.types.bool;
        description = "Whether this platform is Linux-based";
        readOnly = true;  # Computed options are readOnly
        default = config.platform.type == "nixos" || config.platform.type == "droid";
      };
    };
  };

  config = {
    # Assertions for validation
    assertions = [
      {
        assertion = config.platform.type != null;
        message = "Platform type must be detected or manually specified";
      }
    ];

    # Conditional configuration based on platform capabilities
    environment.systemPackages = lib.optionals config.platform.capabilities.supportsNixOS [
      (pkgs.writeShellScriptBin "show-platform" ''
        echo "Platform: ${config.platform.type}"
      '')
    ];
  };
}
```

#### 2. Service Abstraction Pattern

Services provide platform-agnostic interfaces:

```nix
# modules/services/audio/interface.nix
{ lib, config, ... }:

{
  options.services.audio = {
    enable = lib.mkOption {
      type = lib.types.bool;
      description = "Enable audio services";
      default = config.device.capabilities.hasAudio;  # Capability-driven defaults
    };

    backend = lib.mkOption {
      type = lib.types.enum [ "pipewire" "pulseaudio" "coreaudio" "auto" ];
      description = "Audio backend to use";
      default = "auto";
    };

    # Internal implementation details
    _implementation = lib.mkOption {
      type = lib.types.attrs;
      description = "Platform-specific audio implementation";
      internal = true;
      default = {};
    };
  };

  config = lib.mkIf config.services.audio.enable {
    # Capability assertions
    assertions = [
      {
        assertion = config.device.capabilities.hasAudio;
        message = "Audio service requires audio capability";
      }
    ];

    # Auto-select backend based on platform
    services.audio.backend = lib.mkDefault (
      if config.services.audio.backend == "auto" then
        if config.platform.capabilities.isDarwin then "coreaudio"
        else "pipewire"
      else config.services.audio.backend
    );
  };
}
```

#### 3. Platform-Specific Implementation Pattern

```nix
# modules/services/audio/nixos.nix
{ lib, config, pkgs, ... }:

let
  audioConfig = config.services.audio;
  
  # Quality presets organized by backend
  qualitySettings = {
    pipewire = {
      standard = { sampleRate = 48000; bufferSize = 512; };
      high = { sampleRate = 96000; bufferSize = 256; };
    };
  };

in {
  config = lib.mkIf (
    config.services.audio.enable && 
    config.platform.capabilities.supportsNixOS
  ) {
    
    # Conditional service configuration
    services.pipewire = lib.mkIf (audioConfig.backend == "pipewire") {
      enable = true;
      alsa.enable = true;
      pulse.enable = true;
      
      # Dynamic configuration based on quality settings
      extraConfig.pipewire = {
        "99-zyx-audio" = {
          context.properties = qualitySettings.pipewire.${audioConfig.quality};
        };
      };
    };

    # Store implementation metadata for introspection
    services.audio._implementation = {
      platform = "nixos";
      backend = audioConfig.backend;
      pipewireEnabled = config.services.pipewire.enable;
    };
  };
}
```

### Testing Framework Patterns

#### 1. Test Utilities (tests/lib/test-utils.nix)

```nix
{ lib, pkgs ? import <nixpkgs> {} }:

let
  # Core module evaluation function
  evalConfig = modules: lib.evalModules {
    modules = modules ++ [
      { _module.check = false; }  # Disable module checking for testing
    ];
    specialArgs = { inherit pkgs; };
  };

in {
  inherit evalConfig;

  # Test assertion failures
  assertionShouldFail = modules: 
    let result = builtins.tryEval (evalConfig modules).config;
    in !result.success;

  # Create mock hardware configurations
  mkMockHardware = { hasAudio ? false, hasGPU ? false, deviceType ? "vm" }: {
    device = {
      type = deviceType;
      capabilities = { inherit hasAudio hasGPU; };
    };
  };
}
```

#### 2. Unit Test Structure

```nix
# tests/unit/platform/detection-test.nix
{ lib, pkgs }:

let
  testUtils = import ../../lib/test-utils.nix { inherit lib pkgs; };
  platformModule = ../../../modules/platform/detection.nix;
  testConfig = modules: (testUtils.evalConfig modules).config;

in {
  name = "platform-detection";
  tests = [
    {
      name = "platform-type-defaults-to-nixos-on-linux";
      expr = (testConfig [ platformModule ]).platform.type;
      expected = "nixos";
    }

    {
      name = "invalid-platform-type-fails";
      expr = testUtils.assertionShouldFail [
        platformModule
        { platform.type = "invalid"; }
      ];
      expected = true;
    }
  ];
}
```

#### 3. Test Integration with Flake

```nix
# flake.nix
{
  outputs = inputs:
    inputs.flake-parts.lib.mkFlake {inherit inputs;} {
      perSystem = { config, self', inputs', pkgs, system, ... }: {
        checks = {
          tests = (import ./tests { 
            inherit (pkgs) lib;
            inherit pkgs; 
          }).check;
        };
      };
    };
}
```

```nix
# tests/default.nix
{ lib, pkgs }:

let
  testUtils = import ./lib/test-utils.nix { inherit lib pkgs; };
  
  runBasicTests = {
    platformDetection = (testUtils.evalConfig [ 
      ../modules/platform/detection.nix 
    ]).config.platform.type == "nixos";
  };

  allTestsPassed = lib.all (x: x) (lib.attrValues runBasicTests);

in {
  results = runBasicTests;
  check = 
    if allTestsPassed
    then pkgs.writeText "test-success" "All basic tests passed"
    else throw "Basic tests failed: ${builtins.toJSON runBasicTests}";
}
```

### Development Workflow

```

#### 2. Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests via flake
nix flake check

# Test specific modules directly
nix eval --impure --expr '
let 
  pkgs = import <nixpkgs> {};
  lib = pkgs.lib;
  testUtils = import ./tests/lib/test-utils.nix { inherit lib pkgs; };
  result = (testUtils.evalConfig [ 
    ./modules/platform/detection.nix 
  ]).config.platform.type;
in result
'

# Check test results without building
nix eval --impure --expr '(import ./tests { 
  pkgs = import <nixpkgs> {}; 
  lib = (import <nixpkgs> {}).lib; 
}).results'
```

#### 3. Debugging Module Issues

```bash
# Show platform capabilities for debugging
nix eval --impure --expr '
let 
  config = (import ./tests/lib/test-utils.nix { 
    pkgs = import <nixpkgs> {}; 
    lib = (import <nixpkgs> {}).lib; 
  }).evalConfig [ 
    ./modules/platform/detection.nix
    ./modules/platform/capabilities.nix
    { device.type = "laptop"; }
  ];
in {
  platform = config.config.platform.type;
  hasAudio = config.config.device.capabilities.hasAudio;
  isWorkstation = config.config.device.profiles.isWorkstation;
}
'
```

### Integration Patterns

#### 1. Module Import Pattern

```nix
# Modules use relative imports for clarity
platformModule = ../../../modules/platform/detection.nix;

# Tests use consistent relative paths from test directory
testUtils = import ../../lib/test-utils.nix { inherit lib pkgs; };
```

#### 2. Capability-Driven Configuration

```nix
# Services enable based on capabilities
services.audio.enable = lib.mkDefault config.device.capabilities.hasAudio;

# Platform-specific implementations check platform capabilities
config = lib.mkIf (
  config.services.audio.enable && 
  config.platform.capabilities.supportsNixOS
) {
  # NixOS-specific configuration
};
```

#### 3. Error Handling and Validation

```nix
# Use assertions for capability dependencies
assertions = [
  {
    assertion = 
      config.device.capabilities.hasWayland -> 
      (config.device.capabilities.hasGUI && config.device.capabilities.hasGPU);
    message = "Wayland requires both GUI and GPU capabilities";
  }
];

# Provide helpful debug information
environment.systemPackages = lib.optionals config.platform.capabilities.supportsNixOS [
  (pkgs.writeShellScriptBin "show-capabilities" ''
    echo "Device Type: ${config.device.type}"
    echo "Audio: ${lib.boolToString config.device.capabilities.hasAudio}"
    echo "GPU: ${lib.boolToString config.device.capabilities.hasGPU}"
  '')
];
```

### Common Issues and Solutions

#### 1. Module Evaluation Errors

**Problem**: `error: infinite recursion encountered`
**Solution**: Check for circular dependencies in option defaults. Use `lib.mkDefault` instead of direct assignment.

**Problem**: `error: attribute 'platform' missing`
**Solution**: Ensure platform detection module is imported before dependent modules.

#### 2. Test Failures

**Problem**: Tests fail with "assertion failed"
**Solution**: Check that capability dependencies are satisfied in test configurations.

**Problem**: `error: getting status of '/nix/store/.../tests': No such file or directory`
**Solution**: Ensure all test files are committed to git before running `nix flake check`.

#### 3. Performance Issues

**Problem**: Module evaluation takes too long
**Solution**: Use `lib.mkIf` to conditionally evaluate expensive options. Avoid complex computations in option defaults.

### Legacy Integration Notes

The new architecture coexists with the existing system:

- **New modules** go in `modules/platform/` and `modules/services/`
- **Legacy modules** remain in `modules/options/`, `modules/system/`, `modules/home/`
- **Migration strategy** involves gradually moving functionality from legacy modules to new abstractions
- **Testing ensures** no functionality is lost during migration

This reference provides the technical details needed to immediately continue development following established patterns and practices.
